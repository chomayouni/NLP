STAR WARS
                    !! PUBLIC  VERSION !!
  
          ÒA long time ago, in a galaxy far, far 
          away...Ó

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main
title.  War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup 
slowly crawls into infinity.

          ÒIt is a period of civil war.  Rebel 
          spaceships, striking from a hidden 
          base, have won their first victory 
          against the evil Galactic Empire.

          During the battle, Rebel spies managed 
          to steal secret plans to the Empire's 
          ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an 
          armored space station with enough 
          power to destroy an entire planet.

          Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, 
          Princess Leia races home aboard her 
          starship, custodian of the stolen plans 
          that can save her people and restore 
          freedom to the galaxy...Ó

The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness.  A 
tiny silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing 
lasers from the back of the ship, races through space.  It 
is pursed by a giant Imperial Star Destroyer.  Hundreds of 
deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Star Destroyer, 
causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to 
disintegrate.
